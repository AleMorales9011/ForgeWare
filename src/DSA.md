# ForgeAlgo - DSA
Estimated Time: 10 hours<br>
Tech Stack: Java
Keywords: Data Structures - Algorithms<br>
Experience Level: Beginner - Advanced

# Principle 01 Engineering Mindset
DSA is a fully academic topic used by organizations to measure software engineering competence. To be able to solve
their challenges I will use an engineering approach. Min information I need to solve the problem.

# Principle 02 PBL
Apply Pareto's law to learn the least amount of solutions that solve the most amount of problems.

## üî• Most Common (Almost Always Asked)
- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Hash Maps
- Modified Binary Search
- Dynamic Programming
- Backtracking
- Tree Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Tree Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Graphs
- Heaps

## ‚ö° Very Common (Frequently Asked)
- Fast and Slow Pointers
- Sort and Search
- Stacks
- Greedy Techniques
- Subsets (Power Set Problems)
- Top K Elements
- Union Find
- Merge Intervals

## üßê Occasionally Asked (Advanced Problems)
- Topological Sort
- Trie (Prefix Tree)
- Bitwise Manipulation
- K-way Merge
- Cyclic Sort
- Matrices
- In-Place Manipulation of a Linked List

# Principle 03 Lean Learning
I will reuse a lean learning approach to learn solutions and work to fit those into problems with a 3-step approach:
- Step 01 Learn: Learn the solution, don't try to solve yourself.
- Step 02 Build: Define MVS(Minimum viable solution) and memorize it.
- Step 03 Measure: Challenge one self to implement the solution from scratch. 

# Conclusion:
Try to solve similar challenges with it. Treat problems like algebra where there are variables(data structures), 
and formulas (algorithms). Understand variables. Substitute variables into solution
