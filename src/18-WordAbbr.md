# 408. Valid Word Abbreviation
A string can be abbreviated by replacing any number of non-adjacent, non-empty substrings with their lengths. 
The lengths should not have leading zeros. For example, a string such as "substitution" could be abbreviated as 
(but not limited to):

- "s10n" ("s ubstitutio n")
- "sub4u4" ("sub stit u tion")
- "12" ("substitution")
- "su3i1u2on" ("su bst i t u ti on")
- "substitution" (no substrings replaced)
- The following are not valid abbreviations:

- "s55n" ("s ubsti tutio n", the replaced substrings are adjacent)
- "s010n" (has leading zeros)
- "s0ubstitution" (replaces an empty substring)

Given a string `word` and an abbreviation `abbr`, return whether the string matches the given abbreviation. 
A substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.

## Example 1:

Input: word = "internationalization", abbr = "i12iz4n"
Output: true
Explanation: The word "internationalization" can be abbreviated as "i12iz4n" ("i nternational iz atio n").

## Example 2:

Input: word = "apple", abbr = "a2e"
Output: false
Explanation: The word "apple" cannot be abbreviated as "a2e".


## Constraints:

1 <= word.length <= 20
word consists of only lowercase English letters.
1 <= abbr.length <= 10
abbr consists of lowercase English letters and digits.
All the integers in abbr will fit in a 32-bit integer.


# Solution:
```java
package TwoPointers;

public class dAbbreviationValidator {

    public static boolean validWordAbbreviation(String word, String abbr) {
        int i = 0; // pointer for word
        int j = 0; // pointer for abbr

        while (i < word.length() && j < abbr.length()) {
            char current = abbr.charAt(j);

            // 🟠 Case 1: Digit in abbreviation
            if (Character.isDigit(current)) {
                if (current == '0') {
                    return false; // 🚫 Leading zero
                }

                int num = 0;
                while (j < abbr.length() && Character.isDigit(abbr.charAt(j))) {
                    num = num * 10 + (abbr.charAt(j) - '0');
                    j++;
                }

                i += num; // Skip characters in word
            }

            // 🟢 Case 2: Letter in abbreviation
            else {
                if (i >= word.length() || word.charAt(i) != current) {
                    return false; // 🚫 Mismatch
                }
                i++;
                j++;
            }
        }

        // ✅ Both pointers must reach the end
        return i == word.length() && j == abbr.length();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(validWordAbbreviation("internationalization", "i12iz4n")); // true
        System.out.println(validWordAbbreviation("apple", "a2e")); // false
        System.out.println(validWordAbbreviation("substitution", "s10n")); // true
        System.out.println(validWordAbbreviation("substitution", "s010n")); // false (leading zero)
        System.out.println(validWordAbbreviation("substitution", "s0ubstitution")); // false (empty substring)
    }
}

## 🔍 Class Header
```java
package AdHoc;
```
### 🗣️ Say it out loud:
> “This class is part of the `TwoPointers` package.”

### 📘 Explanation:
Organizes your code inside a named package — like putting a file in a folder.

---

```java
public class AbbreviationValidator {
```
### 🗣️ Say it out loud:
> “This is a public class named `dAbbreviationValidator`.”

### 📘 Explanation:
Defines the class where your logic and `main` method will live.

---

## 🧠 Method Declaration
```java
public static boolean validWordAbbreviation(String word, String abbr) {
```
### 🗣️ Say it out loud:
> “Define a public static method called `validWordAbbreviation` that takes a word and an abbreviation, 
and returns true or false.”

### 📘 Explanation:
This method checks if `abbr` is a valid abbreviation for `word`.

---

## 🧮 Pointers Initialization
```java
int i = 0; // pointer for word
int j = 0; // pointer for abbr
```
### 🗣️ Say it out loud:
> “Create two integer pointers `i` and `j`, both starting at zero.”

### 📘 Explanation:
`i` tracks position in `word`, `j` tracks position in `abbr`.

---

## 🔁 Loop Through Characters
```java
while (i < word.length() && j < abbr.length()) {
```
### 🗣️ Say it out loud:
> “While both pointers are within bounds of their strings, keep looping.”

### 📘 Explanation:
Loop continues as long as we haven’t finished parsing both strings.

---

## 🔎 Get the Current Abbreviation Character
```java
char current = abbr.charAt(j);
```
### 🗣️ Say it out loud:
> “Get the current character in `abbr` at position `j`.”

### 📘 Explanation:
Stores the character to decide if it’s a letter or digit.

---

## 🔠 If the Current Character is a Digit
```java
if (Character.isDigit(current)) {
```
### 🗣️ Say it out loud:
> “If the character is a digit...”

### 📘 Explanation:
Abbreviations can include numbers that tell us how many characters to skip in the word.

---

## 🛑 Check for Leading Zero
```java
if (current == '0') {
    return false;
}
```
### 🗣️ Say it out loud:
> “If the digit is zero, return false.”

### 📘 Explanation:
Leading zeros like `01`, `007` are not valid — skip is not allowed to begin with zero.

---

## 🔢 Parse the Number
```java
int num = 0;
while (j < abbr.length() && Character.isDigit(abbr.charAt(j))) {
    num = num * 10 + (abbr.charAt(j) - '0');
    j++;
}
```
### 🗣️ Say it out loud:
> “While we’re still seeing digits, build the full number and move `j` forward.”

### 📘 Explanation:
This handles multi-digit numbers (e.g., `"12"`), and moves the `j` pointer past all digits.

## 🧪 Walkthrough 1: Parsing `"15"`

Let's say `abbr = "a15b"` and we're starting at index `j = 1`.

| Step | `abbr.charAt(j)` | `abbr.charAt(j) - '0'` | `num = num * 10 + digit` | `num value` | `j` |
|------|------------------|------------------------|--------------------------|-------------|-----|
| 1    | `'1'`            | `1`                    | `0 * 10 + 1`             | `1`         | 2   |
| 2    | `'5'`            | `5`                    | `1 * 10 + 5`             | `15`        | 3   |
| 3    | `'b'`            | ❌ not a digit          | —                        | end loop    |     |

✅ Final result: `num = 15`
---

## ⏩ Skip Characters in Word
```java
i += num;
```
### 🗣️ Say it out loud:
> “Move the word pointer forward by that number.”

### 📘 Explanation:
You're skipping over `num` characters in the original word — as instructed by the abbreviation.

---

## 🔤 If It's a Letter
```java
} else {
    if (i >= word.length() || word.charAt(i) != current) {
        return false;
    }
    i++;
    j++;
}
```
### 🗣️ Say it out loud:
> “Otherwise, if it’s a letter, compare it with the current letter in `word`.”

### 📘 Explanation:
If the letters don’t match, it’s invalid. If they do, move both pointers forward.

---

## ✅ Final Check
```java
return i == word.length() && j == abbr.length();
```
### 🗣️ Say it out loud:
> “Return true only if both pointers reached the end of their strings.”

### 📘 Explanation:
We’re only done if both strings are fully parsed — no leftovers.

---

## 🧪 Test Code
```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
```
### 🗣️ Say it out loud:
> “Main method — this is where the program starts.”

### 📘 Explanation:
This is your test area to run the validator with different inputs.

---

```java
System.out.println(validWordAbbreviation("internationalization", "i12iz4n")); // true
System.out.println(validWordAbbreviation("apple", "a2e")); // false
System.out.println(validWordAbbreviation("substitution", "s10n")); // true
System.out.println(validWordAbbreviation("substitution", "s010n")); // false
System.out.println(validWordAbbreviation("substitution", "s0ubstitution")); // false
```
### 🗣️ Say it out loud:
> “Call the method with different test cases and print the results.”

### 📘 Explanation:
Validates both correct and incorrect abbreviations to confirm your logic works as expected.

---

## ✅ Output
```
true
false
true
false
false
```

## ✏️ **Challenges in the Word Abbreviation Problem**
🧠 You're doing something that few learners take the time to do — **extracting wisdom from experience**.
Let’s now reflect on the challenges of the **Word Abbreviation Validation** problem.

| 🔍 Challenge                                                  | 💬 Why It’s Tricky                                                                                                                                             |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Parsing numbers from a string**                          | You have to manually parse digits into full numbers (`"12"` → `12`) without using `Integer.parseInt()` and handle them character by character.                 |
| **2. Dealing with leading zeros**                             | A tricky constraint: abbreviations like `"s010n"` are invalid. You need to explicitly check for `'0'` and reject it early.                                     |
| **3. Using two pointers on two different strings**            | You’re walking two strings at the same time (`word[i]` and `abbr[j]`), and syncing them correctly is **harder than it looks**, especially with skips involved. |
| **4. Skipping characters based on a parsed number**           | Once you parse a number from `abbr`, you skip that many characters in `word`. If you're not careful, you’ll go out of bounds or mismatch letters.              |
| **5. Comparing letters correctly**                            | When not looking at a digit, you're expected to match the character in `abbr` with `word`. A mismatch at any position should immediately return false.         |
| **6. Edge case handling (empty abbreviation, `k = 0`, etc.)** | Handling very short inputs, all-digit abbreviations (e.g., `"10"`), or full word abbreviations requires precise thinking.                                      |
| **7. Returning false on invalid structure**                   | Not all abbreviation attempts are valid — your algorithm needs to catch violations **without false positives**.                                                |
| **8. Knowing when both pointers should end together**         | A valid abbreviation must consume the full `word` and `abbr`. If one finishes early, it’s invalid — that’s easy to forget.                                     |

## 🧠 Bonus Challenge: Manual character-by-character parsing

> Parsing a number from a string without built-in parsing teaches you how **characters and digits relate
> via ASCII math**, which is an **advanced beginner skill** you now have!

## ✅ Summary

| Concept                 | Challenge                                                              |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Dual pointer logic**  | Advancing `i` and `j` correctly with different rules (digit vs letter) |
| **Number parsing**      | Interpreting multiple digits from abbreviation and handling edge cases |
| **Validation**          | Matching letters or rejecting early on invalid abbreviation structure  |
| **Constraint handling** | Rejecting abbreviations with leading zeros or invalid skips            |
| **Final check**         | Making sure both `i` and `j` end together for a full match             |
