# Data Structure and Algorithms


# Principle 01 Engineering Mindset
DSA is a fully academic topic used by organizations to measure software engineering competence. To be able to solve 
their challenges I will use an engineering approach. Min information I need to solve the problem. 

# Step 01 Lean Approach
Apply Pareto's law to learn the least amount of solutions that solve the most amount of problems.

These are important but secondary. They often appear in medium-to-hard difficulty problems but are less fundamental than the first category.

## üßê Occasionally Asked (Advanced Problems)
Topological Sort

These topics appear occasionally in specialized problems, usually in system design interviews or hard problems.

# Step 02 Reuse not Redo
I will reuse solutions and work to fit those into problems.
- Learn the solution
  - Mnemonics
  - Rhythm
- Try to solve similar challenges with it.
Treat problems like algebra where there are variables(data structures), and formulas (algorithms).
  - Understand variables
  - Substitute variables into solution

# Step 03 Simulation (Test)
- Step 01 Learn - Define MVS
- Step 02 Measure - Memorize
- Step 03 Build - Implement


# Step 01 Define MVS
Define the components of the solution that are common for all challenges.

### Two Pointers Algorithm Components

| N¬∫  | **Component**             | **Description** |
|-----|---------------------------|----------------|
| 01  | **Class & Methods**       | Implements the algorithm inside a class with: <br> - **Core Algorithm Method** (contains the two pointers logic). <br> - **Main Method** (defines test cases and calls the algorithm). |
| 02  | **Data Structure**        | Works with **arrays, strings, or linked lists** for linear traversal. |
| 03  | **Two Pointers Initialization** | Define two pointers: <br> - `low = 0` (**left pointer**). <br> - `high = length - 1` (**right pointer**). |
| 04  | **Loop Execution & Termination** | Run a **loop** while `low < high`. <br> - Compare values at `low` and `high` to determine movement. <br> - Adjust pointers: `low++` (right) or `high--` (left). <br> - Loop **stops when pointers meet or cross**. |
| 05  | **Processing & Output**   | Store valid results (if needed). <br> Return or print the processed result. |

| **Step**                       | **Mnemonic**  | **What You Do**                                                                 | **Where It Happens**  |
|--------------------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| **1. Clean the string**        | **CLEAN**  | Ignore non-alphanumeric characters and convert to lowercase. Not always needed. | Adjust `low` and `high` if needed. |
| **2. Place the pointers**      | **PLACE**  | Set `low = 0` (**left pointer**) and `high = length - 1` (**right pointer**).   | `low` ‚Üí **first character**, `high` ‚Üí **last character**. |
| **3. Compare characters**      | **MATCH**  | Check if `s[low] == s[high]`. If not, return `false`.                           | `low` and `high` are pointing at characters being compared. |
| **4. Move pointers**           | **MOVE**  | Shift `low++` (**move right**) and `high--` (**move left**).                    | `low` moves toward the center, `high` moves toward the center. |
| **5. Stop when pointers meet** | **DONE**  | If the loop finishes, return `true` (it's a palindrome).                        | Pointers **meet or cross**. |
| **6. Run the test cases**      | **TEST**  | The main method defines test cases and calls the algorithm.                     | **Main method (`public static void main`)**. |



# Component
```java

// Boolean - the method only returns true or false
public static boolean isPalindrome(String s) {
    //CLEAN
    s = s.replaceAll("[^a-zA-Z0-9]", "").toLowerCase();
    
    //PLACE
    //First pointer - starts on the left (beginning) of the string
    // Second pointer - points to the index of the last character in the string
    int left = 0, right = s.length() -1;
        
        //MATCH
    //Ensures the loop should continue while the left pointer is less than/before the right pointer.     
    while (left < right) {
       
            // If the character at left is different from the character at right, it returns false, meaning the string isn't a palindrome.
            if (s.charAt(left) != s.charAt(right))
            {
                return false;
            }
            
            //MOVE
            //Moves the pointer one step to the left
            left += 1;
            
            //Moves the pointer one step to the right
             right -= 1;
        }
        
        //DONE
        //If the loop completes without finding any mismatched characters, it returns 'true'.
        return true;
    }
```

3. Step 03: Create the main method - which serves as an entry point for your code. It tests the `isPalindrome` method with different test cases.

```java
public static void main(String[] arg) {
    //TEST
    // The array of strings to test the method as it iterates through test cases
    String[] testCase = {
        "RACEACAR",
        "A",
        "ABCDEFGFEDCBA",
        "ABC",
        "ABCBA",
        "ABBA",
        "RACEACAR"
    };

    //The 'for' loop iterates through each string in the array
    for(String test : testCase) {
        System.out.println("Input \n" + test);
        System.out.println("\nIs it Palindrome...? \n" + isPalindrome(test));
    }
}

```
