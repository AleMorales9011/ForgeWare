# ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Understanding the Two-Pointer Technique
Two pointers refer to using `two indices` to traverse a data structure efficiently. There are different variations of
this approach. The most common are:

- `Opposite Ends`  (Left-Right Pointers) â€“ Used for problems like palindrome check, sorting, and pair sum.
- `Same Direction` (Fast-Slow Pointers) â€“ Used for linked lists (detecting cycles), sliding window, and merging sorted 
arrays.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Summary of Two-Pointer Variations**
| Variation            | Use Case Example                |
|----------------------|---------------------------------|
| Opposite Ends        | Two Sum, Palindrome Check       |
| Fast-Slow Pointers   | Cycle Detection, Middle of List |
| Merging Two Pointers | Merge Sort, Merge Arrays        |
| Sliding Window       | Longest Substring, Sub arrays   |
| Removing Elements    | Remove Duplicates, Filtering    |
| Reverse Two-Pointer  | Reverse String, Reverse List    |

# ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Identifying When to Use It
You can use Two-Pointer when: 
- âœ… The problem involves sorted arrays or linked lists.
- âœ… You need to compare elements at different positions.
- âœ… A nested loop (O(nÂ²)) solution exists, and you want to optimize it.
- âœ… It involves pairing elements, finding a sub-array, or checking conditions between two elements.

# ðŸŽ¯ Final Thoughts
The `Two-Pointer technique` is highly adaptable and can be combined with other techniques to optimize solutions across
arrays, graphs, bit manipulation, and dynamic programming.
