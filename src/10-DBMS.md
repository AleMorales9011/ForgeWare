# Prerequisites

1. MySQL Community Server: MySQL Community Server is a free, open-source version of the MySQL relational database management system, widely used for web applications and data-driven platforms, offering essential database features for developers and organizations.
2. MySQL Workbench: MySQL Workbench is a visual design tool for MySQL databases, providing a unified interface for database modeling, SQL development, administration, and data migration tasks.

# Connecting Via CLI

The CLI(command line interface) provides a direct way to interact with the `database server`. 

```ruby
mysql -u root -p
```

# Modeling With MySql Workbench

Modeling with MySQL Workbench is valuable because it allows developers and database administrators to visually design, create, and manage database schemas, making it easier to understand complex relationships, generate SQL scripts, and ensure database structure consistency before implementation.

# SQL Categories

In SQL, there are five main categories of commands, each serving a specific purpose in managing and interacting with databases. By understanding these different categories of SQL commands, you can effectively manage your database, ensuring proper `data structure`, manipulation, `security`, and retrieval capabilities.

# Transactions
Hereâ€™s an example of a transaction in SQL that includes all possible scenarios: `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`, `SAVEPOINT`, and `ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT`. This transaction simulates a banking system where we perform a few account updates, use a savepoint, and handle an error that requires a rollback to a specific point.

```SQL
-- Start the transaction
BEGIN TRANSACTION;

-- Step 1: Deduct $500 from Account A
UPDATE accounts
SET balance = balance - 500
WHERE account_id = 'A';

-- Step 2: Set a SAVEPOINT after deducting from Account A
SAVEPOINT deduct_from_A;

-- Step 3: Add $500 to Account B
UPDATE accounts
SET balance = balance + 500
WHERE account_id = 'B';

-- Step 4: Set another SAVEPOINT after adding to Account B
SAVEPOINT add_to_B;

-- Step 5: Check balances to validate transaction
SELECT account_id, balance FROM accounts WHERE account_id IN ('A', 'B');

-- Let's assume we find an issue here (e.g., Account B is overdrawn due to a previous transaction error),
-- so we decide to ROLLBACK to the savepoint where we had only deducted from Account A.

-- Step 6: Rollback to the savepoint after deducting from Account A
ROLLBACK TO deduct_from_A;

-- Step 7: Now, decide whether to commit the transaction (if everything is fine), or rollback the entire thing
-- In this case, let's assume we fix the issue and commit the transaction
COMMIT;
```
