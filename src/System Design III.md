# Restfull API Design
These tasks involve designing APIs where clients can interact with back-end services using RESTful patterns. The common patterns include:
1. Stateless operations where each request is independent.
2. Rate-limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair resource usage.
3. Authentication (OAuth or API keys) and Authorization to restrict access.
4. Data serialization formats like JSON or XML for communication.

# System Design Pattern
1. Client: Clients send HTTP request
2. Load Balancer: Distributes load
3. API Gateway: Hanldes Authentication, rate limiting, route requests.
4. Authentication and Authorization: OAuth 2.0, API keys, or JWT for authentication. Defines roles and permissions for accessing resources.
5. Caching: Redis, and Memcached for caching frequently accessed data to improve response times.
6. Microservices: Handles specific functionalities.
7. Database: Persistent data storage
8. Monitoring and logging: Centralized logging (e.g., ELK stack, Prometheus) for tracking and analyzing API performance, and debugging.
